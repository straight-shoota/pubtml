Library using Markdown Syntax, HTML, SASS & Compass to create beautiful PDFs
Edit

# Standard process

1. Write: Either in markdown syntax or HTML (or both)
2. Build: All contents are merged in one location
3. Style: Using SASS and Compass individual stylesheets can be created for web and print
4. Print: The HTML code is converted to PDF - via [PrinceXML](http://princexml.com)

This process is fully configurable with rake.
